# Machine Taster (Wine-Quality-analysis)
This is one of my academic projects to analyze the quality and give rating to wine using Machine learning and Data Science. 
Analysis like this will change how quality testing works. This kind of work greatly reduce expenses and thereby help to generate more profit.


P.S: Models giving high performance are saved to future evaluations.
